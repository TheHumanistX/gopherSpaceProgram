# What is the Gopher Space Program?


Strictly for fun, no pressure environment experiment trying to simulate
\****as many gophers as possible***\*, in a tiny gopher universe.
Gophers can do gopher transactions -- anything,
buying stuff, selling stuff, trading 
gophercoins, etc.

I'll be trying to use containerized stuff to move gopher data over web APIs, so any / all
languages are fair game.

Along the way, I'd like to get some contributors to help out with datasets & chaos engineering: some work can be done
on things like alien abductions of gophers,
"missing" transactions from gopher pirates, etc.
