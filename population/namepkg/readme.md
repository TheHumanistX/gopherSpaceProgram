# Gopher Naming Conventions

{Title} FirstName {LastPrefix} LastName {LastAffix} {LastPostAffix}, {Earned Name}, {Moniker}
Where {} is an optional name parameter, and any permutation
of optionals is a valid gopher.


Examples:
```
"Bartholomew von Feral Chicken Nuggets"
"Tina McTubbin Whistles"
"Emperor Hambone Tinkleburg"
"Spok Toast, The Engineer"
```

Gophers can have the same first and last names simultaneously:
```
"Christopher Christopher"
"Wendy Wendy"
```

Multiple gophers can have the same names. They will
be differentiated by both system galactic ID and {Moniker}:

```
"Jim Smith", galactic ID #1
"Jim Smith, The Asteroid, the 2nd", galactic ID #2
```
